## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

DAOsign is a decentralized platform for agreements and automated workflows, with publicly verifiable, cryptographic proofs-of-signature, designed for DAOs and WEB3 companies.
Verifiable Signature is at the core of DAOsign and is based on 3 key proofs: proof-of-identify, proof-of-authority, and proof-of-agreement. Utilizing these proofs, DAOsign provides a platform to design and configure complex workflows that combine smart-contract-based automation with authorized approvals.

Our project integrates into the Substrate, Polkadot, and Kusama ecosystems by leveraging the Substrate framework for building our blockchain infrastructure. By utilizing Substrate, we benefit from its modularity and scalability. Additionally, our integration with Polkadot and Kusama allows for seamless interoperability and cross-chain communication with other blockchain networks, enhancing the overall scalability and utility of our project.

We were solving the problem for ourselves. Before DAOsign, our team was working as a blockchain consulting agency and we regularly had clients who didn't want to disclose their identities, so we were not able to sign any kind of legal agreements with them. Neither DocuSign nor other known solutions back to that time didn't help us to solve this problem.
And after we wrote down our idea in detail and shared it with our clients, friends and partners, we got very positive feedback and realized that it was not only us who were in such a situation.

We would like to have a screening call with you and demo DAOsign, if appropriate

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

Our project addresses the need for secure and efficient agreement signing within the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama ecosystem. It solves the problem of fragmented agreement processes by providing a unified tool that simplifies and standardizes the signing and execution of agreements across different chains. This enhances interoperability, promotes collaboration, and streamlines governance within the ecosystem.

DAOsign has a user-friendly interface and is suitable for almost all users of the web3 industry with different purposes.

We have two categories of competitors: legacy electronic signature tools such as DocuSign and web3 signature tools such as ethsign.xyz. We made some research and a more detailed competitive landscape can be found in our pitch deck.
