## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

**InterBuild** is an innovative plugin for Bubble.io, designed to facilitate the development of decentralized applications (Dapps) on Polkadot. It serves as a bridge for both novices and experienced developers, streamlining the integration of blockchain technology into web applications. 

#### What Problems It Solves, How It Solves Them, and Who It Serves

**The Problem:** The development of Dapps is often hindered by the complexity of blockchain technology, creating barriers for both novice and experienced developers. On the one hand, novices struggle with the technicalities of blockchain connections. On the other hand, advanced developers are looking for ways to create sophisticated, customized solutions while saving time and money.

**Solutions by Audience:**
- _For Novice Developers_, FileBuild revolutionizes backend interaction by converting complex blockchain operations into user-friendly API calls, paired with an intuitive interface. This approach demystifies blockchain technology, allowing beginners to focus on creative aspects without delving into the technicalities, thus making Dapp development accessible and less intimidating.
- _For Advanced Developers_, FileBuild offers an array of advanced features and customization options. It provides the necessary tools to build bespoke, sophisticated Dapp functionalities efficiently. This flexibility caters to the nuanced needs of experienced developers, enabling them to create complex Dapps with enhanced efficiency and precision.
- _For All Users_, FileBuild streamlines the entire Dapp development process, offering straightforward frontend development tools, including pre-built templates and intuitive design elements. It ensures a seamless integration of frontend ease with powerful backend capabilities, delivering a comprehensive development experience that caters to users of all skill levels. 


#### Benefits of FileBuild:

FileBuild offers a comprehensive suite of benefits, transcending the traditional limitations of no-code platforms : 
- _Ease of Use:_ By turning complex blockchain interactions into user-friendly workflows, it opens up Dapp development to a wider audience.
- _Customizability:_ The plugin provides a range of API calls and interfaces to Polkadot functions, catering to the nuanced needs of experienced developers.
- _Efficiency in Development:_ Reducing the time and effort required for both backend and frontend development, FileBuild accelerates the Dapp creation process.
- _Enhanced User Experience:_ With a focus on intuitive design elements and templates, the plugin ensures that the end-users have a seamless experience when engaging with the Dapps. 

#### How our project relates to Polkadot 

Our project, focusing on no-code plugin development for blockchain applications, integrates seamlessly with Polkadot to leverage its robust, interoperable, and scalable infrastructure. By building on Polkadot, we enable users to create decentralized applications (DApps) that can interoperate across various blockchains in the Polkadot ecosystem. This integration allows for a wider range of functionalities and a broader audience reach. Our solution aims to simplify the development process, making blockchain technology more accessible, and to enhance the Polkadot ecosystem by providing an intuitive platform for DApp creation.
We have chosen to focus on Polkadot due to its established stability and wide-reaching ecosystem, which aligns more closely with our project's current objectives and target audience, as opposed to the more experimental nature of Kusama and the blockchain creation focus of Substrate.

#### Why your team is interested in creating this project 

Our team is passionate about democratizing blockchain technology. We believe in its transformative potential and want to make it accessible to a wider audience, regardless of their technical expertise. By creating this project, we aim to simplify the development of decentralized applications, fostering innovation and empowering users to build solutions that can have a real impact in various sectors. This project reflects our commitment to bridging the gap between complex blockchain technology and practical, user-friendly applications.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
