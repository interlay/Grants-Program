# W3F Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Alphaday
- **Team Name:** Alphabox Solutions Pte. Ltd.
- **Payment Address:** 0x48e239Fa0B364Cd92Fc750A50045c9f9E04DD781 (Ethereum)
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 1

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

Alphaday is a powerful workflow aggregator that pulls in crypto news, on-chain data, social media, web3 services and much more into one customizable UI.

Our research showed that crypto users are overwhelmed with information and spend hours jumping from one news source to another, from one social site to another, and usually have dozens of tabs open to stay up to date with everything happening in their favourite community. 

Alphaday builds crypto experience dashboards for enthusiasts, developers, and projects. Users can drag and drop from hundreds of services, news and social feeds, charts, and dapp functionality to create their daily workflows inside a single dashboard. This eliminates the need to have multiple browser tabs open to get different bits of information. i.e. imagine having token prices, gas prices, social feeds, latest news headlines, TVL, borrowing rates and any other information any user could possibly want all within one single dashboard. 

Our application is blockchain-agnostic and can be utilized by any cryptocurrency-based project.

Decentralized infrastructures resonate with us, since we’ve been trying to build and deploy web3 products for the last 5 years.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

Our app is live at : http://app.alphaday.com/
Pitch Deck: https://alphaday.com/deck
Github: https://github.com/AlphadayHQ

Alphaday is a React-Typescript dashboard on the frontend using a Python-Django backend built on distributed infrastructure with Postgres and Redis Databases.

As the application has already been built, deployment risks are significantly reduced but there is always the risk that data sources and APIs will change and we will need to keep updating and maintaining these data sources.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

Category: Social/Tool - A data aggregator as a Community dashboard.

We aim to create a dashboard that serves any Interlay user, developers, VCs, and pretty much any stakeholder whether they are completely new to the Interlay ecosystem or an expert.

Having an Alphaday dashboard for Interlay will make it easier to consume 50+ different types of Interlay-related information in one place. Users can customize this experience to meet their own individual needs. Once they have a solution that is exactly tailored to their needs, they are more likely to stay engaged and informed. 

No other project has tried to aggregate users’ entire workflows into a single easy-to-use experience. Dune/Nansen focus on on-chain data, Messari focuses on investment research, Zapper and Zerion focus on portfolio tracking etc etc. Alphaday from the ground up aggregates every single crypto touch-point whether it's consuming audio and visual content, using dapps, collecting NFTs, or reading discussion forums into one ‘homepage’.

We are aiming to be the de facto homepage for all crypto users. People use Alphaday to stay up to date with their favourite crypto projects, listen to podcasts, do research, participate in discussions and much more. Other competitors are all competing within much narrower niches. We get their services and integrate them into Alphaday so users don’t have to jump from one service to another, it's all available on Alphaday.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months (plus 12 months of maintenance)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  2 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 4,000 USD

### Milestone 1 — Dashboard Development and Deployment

- **Estimated duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:**  1
- **Costs:** 2,000 USD

We would like to create a Interlay ecosystem dashboard that aggregates the following information into a single community dashboard:

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | Blog | The latest Interlay official announcements and blog post content. |
| 0b. | News | A feed of all news mentions of Interlay from coindesk, cointelegraph and 20+ other news sources aggregated from across the internet. |
| 0c. | Calendar | A calendar containing all Interlay events including Interlay Governance votes, meetups, hackathons with Interlay bounties, AMAs. |
| 0d. | Podcast | Podcast feed containing the latest appearances and interviews given by Interlay team members. |
| 0e. | Videos | Youtube stream containing educational Interlay content. |
| 0f. | Documentation | Interlay Documentation directory. |

| 0o. | TVL Data | Interlay TVL data through Defillama integration. |
| 0q. | Team | Interlay team information. |

We should be able to build and deploy the above dashboard within 2 months so if this grant is approved we want to launch the Interlay dashboard by late November 2023 (tentatively).

Thereafter, we will actively maintain & curate the dashboard on a daily basis for at least a year, as well as improve the functionality and availability of features in our application as a whole.

Please note that we can add and remove widgets and/or contents as requested by your team. For a brief idea about other widgets and data that we can include, please visit our Live product page (Beta) at: https://app.alphaday.com/ 

### Milestone 2 — Daily Maintenance of Dashboard

- **Estimated Duration:** 12 months
- **FTE:**  1
- **Costs:** 2,000 USD

Daily maintenance and any other changes, additions, removals, required by the dashboard throughout a year (indefinitely).

## Future Plans

Please include here

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

Our workflow for building the Interlay Community Dashboard is as follows:
1. Our team creates a list of all the sources of information relevant to the Interlay ecosystem (we usually collect 30+ sources including official blog posts, social media, discussion forums, podcasts, etc)
2. We build a draft dashboard that is composed of the widgets we think best serve the Interlay community based on our experience building for other projects.
3. We share the dashboard with the Interlay community and/or team and we collect feedback.
4. We change & iterate based on the feedback and once we get final approval from the community and/or team we publish it.
5. We also do social marketing campaigns to promote the dashboard
6. Optional: We create a Zealy campaign to try to boost early user adoption of the Interlay dashboard.
7. We continue to maintain, curate, and develop the dashboard continuously.
8. If we get any early traction on the Interlay dashboard we can immediately start to build more Interlay-exclusive widgets.
